title: First fieldwork
---

Our project started in January 2014. It lasts three years, into which several fieldwork trips have been planned. The first one was in March 2014 in the river basin of Ižma. We lived in the village of Dijur and visited different settlements each day. Our collegue Marina Fedina had taken care of the preparations and everything was well planned, it also has to be mentioned that our assistant Vasilei Chuprov gave us great help.

During those two weeks we recorded more than 30 sessions. Since then transcribing and filling metadata has been going onward. Basically we have three people spending considerable part of their work time with the project data. The tasks are quite clear cut with segmentation, transcription and translation. It can be questioned whether it is necessary to make translations to both English and Russian, but for we are sticking to this practice.

Our original plan was to work outside Komi Republic. However, now it is easy to say that it was very wise to start from within the Republic. For Iźva dialect of Komi this is the heartland from where they have expanded elsewhere, still keeping all the time connections to the source region of their expansion. We cannot underestimate the mobility of people in the earlier times, if we want to form a coherent picture of the population movements within this dialects speaking area.
