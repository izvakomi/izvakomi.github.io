## Background

Kone Foundation funded Izhva Komi Documentation Project started in January 2014. The project work has been going on actively ever since. On this website we will share some of the results and solutions that have emerged in our daily work. As a bilingual site it will also help in maintaining contact with the language communities and different individuals with who we work.
