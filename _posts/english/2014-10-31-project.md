description: The project has been going on for a year now - what have we got done? Not that little! But the value of work certainly increaces when more people know about it. Many of the solutions we have developed for Saami and Permic languages are instantly usable also with other languages, for which we have taken on this site more general approach to language documentation as a field.

## Background

Kone Foundation funded Izhva Komi Documentation Project started in January 2014. The project work has been going on actively ever since. On this website we will share some of the results and solutions that have emerged in our daily work. As a bilingual site it will also help in maintaining contact with the language communities and different individuals with who we work.
