## IÅºva Komi Documentation Project

This is a website of language documentation project funded by Kone Foundation which focuses to document Izva dialect of Komi language. This site contains materials about our work and how it progresses. As the project lasts three years, it is among the largest documentation projects done with the Uralic languages. We focus heavily to metadata and archiving, making sure that the end users, be they linguists or native Komi, will have easy and intuitive access to our data.

We encourage the students and researchers to contact us for getting access to the developing version of the corpus

It is possible to read more about our team (here)[http://0.0.0.0:4000/Project_started/].

To this end we have developed several tools that facilitate our own data processing, but maybe are also useful for others. We have also written manuals for existing tools. All source code for this page and presented projects can be downdloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/).

The site uses multilingual Jekyll template created by [Sylvain Durand](https://github.com/sylvaindurand/sylvaindurand.github.io).[[Everything that works on this site is because of him, and everything that's broken is my fault.]]
