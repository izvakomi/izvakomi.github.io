description: In many ways it is rather irrelevant which transcription system we use. Real question is how do we understand the phonological system. However, the different decisions of different researchers very often turn to our headaches as we recover and work on with the heritage data. Using different scripts can help enormously both in checking consistency and in converting from transliteration system to another.

## Inbetween transliteration systems

It is a continuous problem while working with language data that different transcriptions are done in very different transcription systems. The most common ones are Finno-Ugric transcription and different Cyrillic transcription systems. In many ways also Finno-Ugric transcription consists from many different subsystems, as different authors have used it in somewhat idiosynchronic manner. However, the majority of the systems used are in essence phonemic, thereby not marking really anything more than Komi orthography does.

As an example Hungarian researcher Erik Vászolyi often transcribed Komi phoneme that is usually represented with orthographical <ӧ> with <ø> in his own transcriptions. It marks exactly the same phoneme basically in the same environment, which in the end makes it quite irrelevant which grapheme is used.

Nevertheless, if we want to search for one word or sound across different texts we need to have them in the same system. As I see it, which system one uses is quite irrelevant. The most important thing is probably that you can type it fast and easily, because that way you have more transcriptions! However, they all have to attempt to capture the same phonological system with the same level of exactness. From this one variant we can always derive other transcription systems through simple transliteration.[[In practice this may be somewhat complicated. Problem is that phonemic transcript implies that the transcriber understands the phonological system of this particular speech variety, yet this system is rarely made explicit!]]

I wrote a little web application that is supposed to do exactly that. It is a prototype and it works for now only with one Southern Udmurt dialect. However, in order to demonstrate the idea that works well. And one colleague needed help with converting her transcriptions, so this was the least we could do.
